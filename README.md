# api_blog_tests

# Tools:
# Java + JUnit + Maven and RestAssured library

# Tests are integrated with CircleCi and build successfully. But I believe that the tests are not running properly because I need to understand how to call them on config file. 

# I push the commit for the whole project on github, but what I would like to be done was:
# 1 - push files: UsersApi, UserApiTests and Constants with username strings;
# 2 - push files: PostsApi, PostsApiTests and Constants with userids.
# 3 - push files: CommentsApi, CommentsApiTests, Helpers package and Constants with postid.
